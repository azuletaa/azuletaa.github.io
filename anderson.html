            <h2>Crime and punishment</h2>
            <p>Considered by critics as Dostoevsky's first masterpiece, Crime and Punishment is a profound psychological analysis of its protagonist, the young student Raskolnikov, whose firm belief that humanitarian ends justify evil leads him to the murder of a loan shark. But from the moment he commits the crime, guilt will be a constant nightmare with which the student will be unable to live.</p>

            <h2>Media Literacy</h2>
            <p>We invite you to deepen in this set of competencies related to the interpretation, management and handling of information and media and socio-digital content, which focuses on the literacy development of different skills and knowledge that manage to transform the types of interaction that people make and have with the informational and media of their environments.</p>
            <img src="multimedia/Ander/medialiteracy.jpg" width="560" alt=""></a>
            <p>"The program has two main objectives: on the one hand, to help people understand how the media works today, how it uses algorithms and discourses to generate trends, violence or disinformation. On the other hand, to encourage the active participation of people, especially young people, to intervene in the messages and counteract disinformation with truthful data, empathy and substantive issues," says Adolfo Rodriguez.</p>
